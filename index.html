INTRO

<h3>"Look here I will not bit about the bush, I may not be as bad as that clown Fikile, but it is clear that am no longer as effective as before, I cannot function freely because of the corrupted government. I look like an idiot in a police uniform, look now am supposed to solve this Xhenophobia saga which they created to shift focus from the Watson case. That is why I am appointing you to head this case, Do you accept this challenge?"</h3>

"You need to find out what happened, was it a foul play, just an accident or his death was faked. Your first lead is to target the two eye witnesses, who claim to have seen this. however you have a very limited time to crack the case, do not attract negative publicity, and stay alive.."
[Bheki.jpg]

- Go to the witness [WITNESS]

WITNESS

"Tell me what you saw on that day?" [guy.png] 

"I saw mr Watson speeding a white Toyota towards the arrival area as the road curved he did not slow down and hit the concrete pillar" [gal.png]

- Move to the next witness [WITNESS2]
- Continue interview[THE FIGHT]

- Restart [INTRO]
THE FIGHT
"How did you know that it was Mr Watson?" [guy.png]

"I assume it was him, since they found his body there" [gal.png]

"So you saw the body?" [guy.png]

"No Officer I only saw the car"

- Move to the next witness. [WITNESS2]
- Continue interview. [CONTINUATION]
- Take the witness into custody.[PUBLICITY]

CONTINUATION
Time running out...the witness is starting to loose patience with you!
"It seems like you are unsure of your stories, am beginning to doubt your testimony" [guy.png]

"Am I your suspect Officer, cause if that is the case I would need my lawyer?" [gal.png]

- Allow the witness to call their lawyer. [THE LAWYER]
- Move to the next witness[WITNESS2]

THE LAWYER
<h3>Unfortunately you have run out of time and the lawyer has discredited the methods you used on his client, you have reached a dead End!!!</h3>
	                                                           <h3>Game Over!</h3>
WITNESS2
<h3>Detective your second witness gave almost the same statement except that he claims that he is a hero, he went to the scene after the accident...</h3>

- Interview the second witness[WITNESS2TEST]
- Go to the scene[PHONECALL]

WITNESS2TEST

"Tell me about what you saw at the scene, what did you see there?"

"I saw the Toyota crashed beyond recognition on the front, I could have saved him, I mean I am the world's greatest "

"Did you see the body?"

"No I did not, as we were blocked from the scene, I mean am not an angel"

"Is there anything atleast what you noticed, anything?"

"Well I have no matric but it was strange that the officers who were attending to this, were not wearing gloves and there was no red tape"
                                                            [Hlaudi.png]
<h3>Clearly something is fishy about this case, nobody saw Mr Watson driving the car or his body after the accident,
and what this witness has just said gives you a reason to dig deeper...How about you go to the scene, who knows you might find something.</h3>

"Look here I will not bit about the bush, I may not be as bad as that twitter clown Fikile Mbalula, but it is clear that am no longer as effective as before, I am useless!!! I cannot function freely because of the current, corrupted government . I look like an idiot in a police uniform, look now I had to solve this Xenophobia saga which they created to shift focus from the Watson case. That is why I am appointing you to head this case, Do you accept this challenge?"

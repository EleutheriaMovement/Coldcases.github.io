I cannot function freely because of the corrupted government. I look like an idiot in a police uniform, look now am supposed to solve this Xenophobia saga which they created to shift focus from the Watson case. That is why I am appointing you to head this case, Do you accept this challenge?"</h3>

"I saw the Toyota crashed beyond recognition on the front, I could have saved him, I mean I am the world's greatest "[no.png]

"Did you see the body?"[no.png]

"No I did not, as we were blocked from the scene, I took steps of leadership but could'nt, I mean am not an angel"[no.png]

"Is there anything atleast that you noticed, anything?"

"Well I have no matric but it was strange that the officers who were attending to this, were not wearing gloves and there was no red tape"
                                                            
<h3>Clearly something is fishy about this case, nobody saw Mr Watson driving the car or his body after the accident,
and what this witness has just said gives you a reason to dig deeper...How about you go to the scene, who knows you might find something.</h3>
